# Gb-rs

# This repo is dead.

In the process of writing this emulator I learned a lot about writing Rust and structuring larger Rust projects.  After some time of I've decided to cease any work on this at this time.  I do plan on starting a new rust emulator project targeting another CPU to learn from the mistakes I made with this project.

# Original Readme

Gb-rs is my attempt at writing a gameboy emulator in Rust.

I'd like to give credit to [ mehcode ]( https://github.com/mehcode ) for his 
great emulator [wadatsumi](https://github.com/mehcode/wadatsumi), its been a great
reference for both writing emulators and Rust.  

I'd also like to give a shoutout to [yupferris](https://github.com/yupferris) for
the inspiration to write both emulators and get more familiar with Rust.
